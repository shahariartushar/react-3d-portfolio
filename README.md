# 3D Portfolio Project

This is a portfolio project showcasing my skills in React, ThreeJS, TailwindCSS, and Framer Motion. The project is a 3D website with stunning graphics and smooth animations, featuring custom 3D models, interactive components, and a responsive design. I have also implemented industry-standard best practices such as Higher Order Components (HOCs), sending emails through a form, and using Suspense and Preload for improved performance. This project demonstrates my expertise in web development, 3D graphics, and user experience design.
